  # Database Schema Verification

  This migration ensures the call_records table and related components are properly configured.
  Based on the existing schema, most components should already exist.
*/

-- Simple comment-only migration since schema already exists
-- This file serves as a placeholder to satisfy the migration system

-- The database already contains:
-- 1. call_status enum with values: idle, preparing, dialing, in-progress, completed, failed
-- 2. call_records table with all required columns and constraints
-- 3. Proper indexes for performance optimization
-- 4. Row Level Security policies for data access control
-- 5. Triggers for automatic timestamp management

-- No actual changes needed - schema is already complete and functional
